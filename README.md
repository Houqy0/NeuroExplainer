# NeuroExplainer: Fine-Grained Attention Decoding to Uncover Cortical Development Patterns of Preterm Infants

## Description
NeuroExplainer is an explainable geometric deep network adopting a hierarchical attention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained attention and discriminative representations in a spherical space to accurately recognize preterm infants from term-born infants.
NeuroExplainer learns the hierarchical attention-decoding modules under subject-level weak supervision coupled with targeted regularizers deduced from domain knowledge regarding brain development. These prior-guided constraints implicitly maximize the explainability metrics (i.e., fidelity, sparsity, and stability) in network training, driving the learned network to output detailed explanations and accurate classifications.
