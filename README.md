# NeuroExplainer: Fine-Grained Attention Decoding to Uncover Cortical Development Patterns of Preterm Infants

## Description
NeuroExplainer is an explainable geometric deep network adopting a hierarchical attention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained attention and discriminative representations in a spherical space to accurately recognize preterm infants from term-born infants.
NeuroExplainer learns the hierarchical attention-decoding modules under subject-level weak supervision coupled with targeted regularizers deduced from domain knowledge regarding brain development. These prior-guided constraints implicitly maximize the explainability metrics (i.e., fidelity, sparsity, and stability) in network training, driving the learned network to output detailed explanations and accurate classifications.

## Package Dependency
- python (3.6)
- pytorch (0.4.1+)
- torchvision (0.2.1+)
- tensorboardx (1.6+)
- NumPy (1.11.3)
- SciPy (1.2.1)
- pyvista (0.22.4+)
## Step 0. Environment setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ladderlab-xjtu/NeuroExplainer.git
```
You can use conda to easily create an environment for the experiment using following command:
```
conda create -n neuroexplainer python=3.6 
conda activate neuroexplainer
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge pyvista
```
To install the required packages, run:
```
pip install .
```

## Step 1. Data preparation
## Step 2. Training
### Train
After data prepration, modify the [main.py](https://github.com/qianyuhou/NeuroExplainer/blob/main/main.py) file to match the training data in your own path. To save the coresponding models and results, the save directories must be manually changed. Then, run:
```
python main.py
```
If successful, you will see
```

The GPU memory consumption may vary depending on CUDA kernels.
### Test
In this step, you can calculate the accuracy of classification for preterm and term-born infants and obtain the output attention maps on surface and sphere. To predict a single surfaceâ€™ attention map, you need to modify the [test.py](https://github.com/qianyuhou/NeuroExplainer/blob/main/test.py) file to match the data in your own path. To save the attention maps of the left and right brain at the sphere and surface, the save directories must be manually changed or created. In this step, you can use the saved model `./muilt_view_10242_ori_$epoch_max_acc.pkl` in Step 2.
### Visualization
You can use [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) software to visualize the attention map in VTK format. An example of the coarse-grained attention map and the fine-grained attention map of preterm infant are shown below. More usages about Paraview please refer to [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).
