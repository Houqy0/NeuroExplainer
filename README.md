# NeuroExplainer: Fine-Grained Attention Decoding to Uncover Cortical Development Patterns of Preterm Infants

## Description
NeuroExplainer is an explainable geometric deep network adopting a hierarchical attention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained attention and discriminative representations in a spherical space to accurately recognize preterm infants from term-born infants.
